## Docker
Simple example of running a Connect environment using Docker Compose.  The stack uses SoCat and PostgreSQL to show how you can secure simple Layer 4 services.

[./docker_compose](./docker_compose)

## Kubernetes
A more fully featured example of a small microservice system running in Kubernetes.  This example shows how to register services with Consul as they start as K8s pods, run Connect in a sidecar, and leverage the Go SDK for native integration.
